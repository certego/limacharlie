## Documentation
Most of the documentation is now found on the [LC wiki](https://github.com/refractionPOINT/limacharlie/wiki).

[LimaCharlie Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR0GhNmc4gVcD9Uj07HS5AA) contains overview and tutorial videos.

## Overview
LIMA CHARLIE is an endpoint security platform. It is itself a collection of small projects all working together
to become the LC platform. LC gives you a cross-platform (Windows, OSX, Linux, Android and iOS) low-level 
environment allowing you to manage and push (in memory) additional modules to. The main module (at the moment) 
is the HBS sensor, which provides telemetry gathering and basic forensic capabilities.
 
Many of those individual features are provided through other platforms, so why LC? LC gives you a single 
messaging, cloud and analytic fabric that will integrate with anything and scale up. Sensor is extra-light
and installs nothing on the host.

Ultimately LC is meant to be a platform for the security community to experiment with, a starter kit to have the 
endpoint monitoring you want or to the platform enabling you to try new endpoint techniques without the hassle of
rebuilding the basics.)

## Core Values
LIMA CHARLIE's design and implementation is based on the following core values:
* Reduce friction for the development of detections and operations.
* Single cohesive platform across Operating System.
* Minimize performance impact on host.

## Top Questions
### What is the difference between LC and GRR?
LC is a constant monitoring platform, whereas GRR is a forensic platform. Concretely it means that GRR is more adapted
to point-in-time analysis and data gathering, while LC is better at constantly be on the lookup for techniques, IOCs
or to gather telemetry to model for anomalies in the cloud. Because LC is designed to be constantly running all its
detection methods, a lot of emphasis is put on using very little resources, in contrast to a common GRR usage where an 
investigator knows malware is present on a host and doesn't mind having high usage utilization.

## Next Steps
Please, feel at home contributing and testing out with the platform, it's what its for. HBS currently has some limitations
, mainly around being User Mode only. User Mode is great for stability (not going to blue screen boxes) and speed
of prototyping, but it lacks many of the low level event-driven APIs to do things like getting callbacks for processes
creation. So here are some of the capabilities that are coming:
- Kernel Mode thin module providing low level events and APIs.
- Make Linux and OS X capabilities on par with Windows.
- Keep on adding detections and modeling to enable better and faster hunting.
